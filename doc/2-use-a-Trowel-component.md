# Use a Trowel component

*Trowel* is a scss plugin for visual component framework (like bootstrap, foundation, etc.). What we call *Trowel component* is a visual component using Trowel.

A *Trowel component* can be built by anyone (see [Create your own Trowel component](3-create-your-own-trowel-component.md)), and you can find into the [FriendsOfTrowel github's organisation](https://github.com/FriendsOfTrowel) all the *Trowel components* created and maintened by the core team.

We will see in this chapter how to install, use and customize a *Trowel component*.
